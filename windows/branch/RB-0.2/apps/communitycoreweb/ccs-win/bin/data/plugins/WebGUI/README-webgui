README - WebGUI
-----------------------------

- Multiple GUI pages may be described by duplicating plugins/WebGUI/gui/testGui.xml and altering
as necessary.

- Start the server and navigate to localhost:8910 (by default)

- Methods of interacting with the GUI:
	- Use the jQuery client
	- Make a HTTP GET request (using browser or otherwise) to localhost:8910/control to get a JSON
		description of the current state of the UI
	- Making an HTTP GET request (using browser) to localhost:8910/control?key=TestToggle will retrieve the current value of the element named TestToggle.
    - Making another HTTP GET request to localhost:8910/control?key=TestToggle&amp;value=true will SET the value of the toggle.
    
- Networked operation:
    - You can get the local network IP of the machine running CCW, for example, by opening a terminal
    	and typing ifconfig -a and examining the output (NOT 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.255, the other one)
    	
    - Then you can access the UI from another machine on the network in any of the ways detailed above
    	by replacing 'localhost' with the IP address.
